# Azure Developer Certification Suite - Learning Roadmap
**Target**: AZ-204 (Developer Associate) + AZ-400 (DevOps Engineer Expert)

## Phase 1: Frontend Foundation
**Objective**: Deploy production-ready React frontend with Infrastructure as Code
- React application with TypeScript and ES modules
- Azure Static Web Apps deployment with custom domain
- **ARM Templates**: Learn JSON structure, functions, and conditions
- **Bicep Templates**: Modern IaC for Static Web Apps infrastructure
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- Basic authentication UI components

## Phase 2: Serverless Microservices
**Objective**: Build event-driven backend architecture
- Azure Functions (Python) for core services:
  - Authentication service with JWT handling
  - Image upload service with validation
  - Image processing service with triggers
- Azure Service Bus for async messaging
- Azure Blob Storage for image storage (hot/cool tiers)
- Azure Key Vault for secrets management
- Managed Identity for service-to-service authentication
- Azure Cosmos DB integration for user data
- Event Grid for event-driven workflows

## Phase 3: API & Monitoring Layer
**Objective**: Production-ready API management and observability
- Azure API Management with policies and rate limiting
- Application Insights with custom telemetry
- Azure Monitor dashboards and alerts
- Log Analytics queries for troubleshooting
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Health checks and availability tests

## Phase 4: Containerization
**Objective**: Container-based deployments and orchestration
- Docker containerization of all services
- Azure Container Registry with security scanning
- Azure Container Apps deployment (serverless containers)
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with Helm charts
- Container networking and security
- Auto-scaling policies

## Phase 5: Advanced DevOps
**Objective**: Production-grade CI/CD and deployment strategies
- Multi-stage Azure DevOps YAML pipelines
- **Infrastructure testing**: ARM template validation, Bicep linting
- SAST/DAST security scanning integration
- Blue-green and canary deployment strategies
- Feature flags and progressive rollouts
- Automated rollback mechanisms

## Phase 6: Production Readiness
**Objective**: Enterprise-grade security, performance, and reliability
- Load testing with Azure Load Testing
- Disaster recovery and backup strategies
- Network security with Private Link and NSGs
- Cost optimization and resource governance
- Compliance and audit logging
- Performance tuning and optimization

## Cost Management Strategy
- **Free Tier Services**: Functions (1M executions), Static Web Apps (100GB), Cosmos DB (1000 RU/s)
- **12-Month Free**: Blob Storage (5GB), Service Bus (13M operations), Key Vault (10K ops)
- **Always Free**: Event Grid (100K ops), API Management (1M calls), Container Apps (180K vCPU-sec)
- **Target**: $0-5/month for entire learning environment
